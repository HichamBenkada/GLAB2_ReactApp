## Introduction:

This project is to showcase my FrentEnd development abilities creating single page web application using React.

## Objectives:
This project is to demonstrate my ability to:
- Use npm create vite@latest to make a pre-configured React application.
- Create React components.
- Render React components within an application.
- Pass props to React components to modify their behavior.

## Implementation:
For the project a react folder applicatin is created using Vite@latest. It includes:
- The main application layout _App.jsx_ and _App.css_
- Components folder includes three compnents for this simple application 
    - _Header_ :this would contain the header of the page such as the title, the logo and a navigation bar
    - _Content_: this section would contain any main layout of the page

    - _Footer_ this section would have the content of the bottom of the page and navigation links
